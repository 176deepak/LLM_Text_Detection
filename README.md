# LLM Text Detection WebApp
This is a Deep Learning based WebApp. That can detectsüïµÔ∏è the text writer or classify the texts. Whether the text is generated by Large Languages Models(LLMs)ü§ñ or written by Humanüë®.

## Project Structure Understanding(Folders and Files):
- `README.md`: File for writing project documentation, execution documentation, etc.
- `.gitignore`: File for writing all folders and files which is ignored by the version control system.  
- `setup.py`: File, responsible for packaging the whole project. 
- `requirements.txt`: File, contains all required library, modules. 
- `src`: Folder contains main code files for model building.
   1. `__init__.py`: Constructor file, makes the src folder as project or module.
   2. `logger.py`: Code file for recording all project logs into seperate LOGs file. 
   3. `exception.py`: Code file for handling all exceptions occured during code execution.
   4. `utils`: Folder, for storing code files which contains all utility functions.
      1. `common.py`: Code file, contains utility functions.
   5. `entity`: Folder, for storing files which contains the configurations variables or configuration classes for Application. 
   6. `constants`: Folder contains files, which contains all constant file paths or .yaml files path.
   7. `config`: Folder contains configuration files
      1. `configuration.py`: Code file which extract all configurations from .yaml files or add configuration variables.
   8. `components`: Folder, contains files for all stages of Model Development.
      1. `data_ingestion.py`: Code file, load the datasets or data from database.
      2. `data_transformation.py`: Code file, Which transform, clean, filter the loaded data and splits into train, test and validation splits.
      3. `data_validation.py`: Code file, which validates the all splits.
      4. `model_training.py`: Code file, Which trains the model on splited data.
      5. `model_evaluation.py`: Code file, which evaluates the model on validation data and test data.
